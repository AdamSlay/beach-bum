# BEACH BUM (wip)
This is a simple 2D game engine written in C++ using SDL2. I mostly made this as a learning experience. I was interested in graphics and 
rendering, and I really wanted to build these systems from scratch(yes, the SDL2 library helps, I'm not a masochist lol). 
Also, I just love video games and I came up with this little character a while back, so I wanted to use him for something.
The platforms and background are procedurally generated on each run, so the game is different every time. The player can move left and right,
and jump. If the player falls off the lime green ground, they will respawn at the starting position. It's really just a simple platformer learning exercise.

It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.

However, here is a gif of the current progress:

Here, you can see a different background and set of platforms is generated on this run:
